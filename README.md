# ReadMe Generator
  ## Description  
  This project dynamically generates a README.md file from user niput. When entering node index.js from the command prompt from the file path where you downloaded the project, a series of prompts will show up on the screen for the user to answer. The README file will then overwrite the readme file in this directory. Not to worry, if you need to refer to the correct README file for this project, simply return to my GitHub where you can view it.
